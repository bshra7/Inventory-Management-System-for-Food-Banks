# <h1> **Project Background:** </h1>

All food banks across the province face a common issue, there is an uneven distribution of food supplies. 
Some places have a surplus number of certain foods while the others lack the same. 
These problems lead to increased food wastage and food not reaching its target, 
thus undermining the purpose of a food bank despite the availability of sufficient food. Our project focus is to solve this problem, by creating a common platform (hub) in which different banks can share their inventory information and food requirements to fulfill the needs of the community thereby reducing food wastage. 

# <h1> **Project Goals:** </h1>
- To reduce food waste, by prioritzing items nearing expiration
- To ensure that food banks across the province can share their surplus with neighbouring food banks using an inventory management system to track surplus in goods
- Improve inter bank communication, by centralizing communication in one consice platform, insread of the traditional ways such as emials, phone calls, etc which usually casue miscommunication and long delays
