# <h1> **Project Background:** </h1>

All food banks across the province face a common issue, there is an uneven distribution of food supplies. 
Some places have a surplus number of certain foods while the others lack the same. 
These problems lead to increased food wastage and food not reaching its target, 
thus undermining the purpose of a food bank despite the availability of sufficient food
